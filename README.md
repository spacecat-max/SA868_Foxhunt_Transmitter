# Morse Code Hidden Transmitter

## Objective 
The objective of this project is to create a cheaper alternative for a foxhunter transmitter that doesn't involve a handheld radio.
"Foxhunting", otherwise known as "Transmitter hunting" is a game where transmitters send out occassional radio signal which is received by the player.
This can be done either with a handheld radio attached to a directional antenna or with a network analyzer in the case there are multiple transmitters on differing frequencies. 

## Setup 
This project uses a DRA818U module which operates in the UHF range. The library used is fatpat's [arduino-dra818 library](https://github.com/fatpat/arduino-dra818). 

### Wiring
The current wiring of the project is:

### Code
more to come!

## TO DO
## Hardware
[ ] determine how to power the module <br />
[ ] solder breadboard for more secure connections<br />

## Software
[X] edit current written code to correlate to wiring + test <br />
[X] transmit morse code on a specific frequency<br />
[ ] comment code for clarity<br />
[ ] update code because i know how serial works now<br />
[ ] reformat repo, deleting unnecesary files<br />

## Futher goals
[ ] create 3 different modules operating on different frequencies <br />

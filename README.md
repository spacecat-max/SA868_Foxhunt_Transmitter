REMINDER: this module is the DRA818U meaning it only operates in UHF

TO DO:
[X] edit current written code to correlate to wiring + test
[X] transmit morse code on a specific frequency
[ ] solder breadboard for more secure connections
[ ] determine how to power the module 
[ ] create 3 different modules operating on different frequencies
